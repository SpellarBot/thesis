<p>ASMs are</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically ASMs can be defined as a natural generalization of Finite4 The ASM Method State Machines (FSMs) by extending FSM-states to Tarski structures. Tarski structures, also called first-order or simply mathematical structures, represent truly abstract data types. Therefore, extending the special domains of FSM-computations to these structures turns finite state machines into abstract state machines [...].</p>

<p>Basically there are three stumbling blocks for a designer of software and/or hardware engineers, when they want to develope a system: - size, - complexity - and trustworthiness <span class="citation" data-cites="boerger:2003">[@boerger:2003, p.1]</span>.</p>
<p>The ASM-method is suited for procedural single-agent and for asynchronous multiple-agent distributed systems.</p>
<p>The method bridges the gap between a human understannding and formulation of real-world problems and the deployment of their algorithmic solutions (implementation as a software and/or hardware machine).</p>
<p>The ASM-method enables engineers to - develop a <em>ground model</em>. The ground model represents a correct and complete human-centric task formulation. This is the result of the requirements captuure process. It is basically the binding contract between the application domain expert (usually the customer) and the system designer - refine the ground model. Several intermediate models constitute a <em>hierarchy of refined models</em>. - link the most detailed specification to generated code which should show that the model of the system is correctly solved according to the ground model (the contract with the customer)</p>
<p>The ASM-method lets the developer/engineer decide at any given point, which layer of abstraction he chooses. As any machine can have a function which is more or less powerful (which resembles the granularity of abstraction).</p>
<p>The most important practical benefit of the ASM-method is to provide a simple and precise framework to cimmunicate and docment design ideas and a support for an accurate and checkable overall understanding of complex systems.</p>
<p>ASM-method makes heavy use of pseudo-code. But what does it add to the long existing method of pseudo-code development? To read and write ASMs no knowledge of the underlying theory is needed. Though it is the mathematical underpinning which makes the method work. The ASM-method &quot;complete(s) the longstanding structural programming endeavour by lifting it from particular machine or programming notation to truly abstract programming on arbitrary structures&quot;.</p>

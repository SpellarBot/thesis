Full state-space exploration (search) of a program

a model is a Kripke structure
$\phi$ is some temporal logical property

Difference between hardware and software model checking is, that state space
of software is usually several order of magnitude larger than those of hardware systems.

the two approaches in model checkings are

1. logical approaches based on fixed point computation
2. and automata theoretic approaches based on language containment (??? was ist das)

# Discussion and Future Work

Above and beyond the topics discussed and proposed in this thesis, I want to emphasize
the importance of open communities. NGOs and civil organizations who work for global 
causes like climate change too need all kinds of tools. Among them, also process
management tools. Therefore I want to spread the idea of an open business platform
like recommended and proposed in [@opensbpm].
